The hello_xr D3D12 graphics-requirements, swapchain ownership and fence model
were consulted. Original M0 code uses a simpler CPU-transformed scene and
single-flight GPU queue. No third-party game mod code was adopted.
See GITHUB_REUSE_RESEARCH.md for earlier reconnaissance, not validation.

After hardware M0 acceptance, G1 first records exact legally owned game
version/storefront and executable hash (no proprietary payload), permissions,
network/anti-cheat implications, publicly available diagnostics and DX12
presentation evidence. Compare possible camera/frame-ownership approaches
using evidence only. Deliver an integration plan or stop decision before
implementing any hooks. No G1 experiment was performed during this M0 work.


## Pinned upstream stereo-source review

See [the static pipeline audit](research/stereo-pipeline-audit.md) for pinned
Cyberpunk VR and REFramework camera/render/submission paths, selected direct
dependency licenses, limits and adoption decision. No mod code or dependencies
were adopted; builds and game/hardware execution were NOT_RUN. This read-only
preparation does not advance the M0 hardware gate.
